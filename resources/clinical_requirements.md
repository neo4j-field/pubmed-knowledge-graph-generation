## PubMed Knowledge Graph for Protocol and Formulary Evaluation  
**Solara Health â€“ Clinical Leadership Review**

---

## ðŸ§© Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a PubMed-powered Knowledge Graph to help Solara Health evaluate, optimize, and suggest clinical protocols and formulary changes based on both clinical evidence and member outcomes. This supports Solaraâ€™s mission to deliver high-quality, evidence-based care.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals and Objectives

1. **Aggregate PubMed literature** into a searchable graph for treatments, drugs, procedures, conditions, and outcomes.
2. **Link evidence to existing Solara protocols** to assess clinical alignment and outcome support.
3. **Evaluate member journey outcomes** against published expectations to identify underperforming protocols.
4. **Suggest candidate protocols or formulary drugs** backed by evidence, particularly for high-cost or high-risk populations.
5. **Enable clinicians to explore evidence** related to specific patients, conditions, or treatments.

## ðŸ‘¥ Key Users and Personas

### Lead Data Scientist (Kansas-based)
- Designs and manages the evidence graph.
- Performs outcome comparisons and formulary ranking.
- Builds recommendation logic for clinical strategy.

### Clinician (Virginia-based)
- Reviews protocols based on aligned outcomes from literature.
- Identifies patients whose outcomes diverge from expectations.
- Explains and justifies care pathways to care managers and patients.

## ðŸ›  Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-01 | Ingest PubMed abstracts and metadata based on flexible query terms (e.g., drug, procedure, condition) | High |
| FR-02 | Extract and normalize medical entities (Drug, Condition, Outcome, Protocol) | High |
| FR-03 | Build a Neo4j-based knowledge graph linking entities with contextual relationships | High |
| FR-04 | Support queries to compare protocols based on literature evidence | High |
| FR-05 | Cross-reference protocols with internal patient outcomes | Medium |
| FR-06 | Highlight underperforming protocols or segments | Medium |
| FR-07 | Suggest alternative treatments or drugs based on literature frequency and match | Medium |
| FR-08 | Enable user-friendly dashboards or LLM-driven summaries | Medium |

## ðŸ¤– Technical Features (Planned)

- **Entrez API integration** to retrieve PubMed articles.
- **NLP and entity extraction** using regex or LLM (SciSpacy / MedPaLM).
- **Cypher generator** for ingesting data into Neo4j.
- **LLM + LangGraph orchestration** for summarizing and recommending protocols.
- **Optional dashboards** using NeoDash or a custom frontend.

---

## âœ… Success Criteria

- Top 5 protocols mapped to relevant evidence with >80% entity extraction precision.
- At least 3 formulary candidates identified through literature analysis.
- One clinical committee meeting per quarter supported by automated evidence packet.
- Clinicians able to review PubMed-backed rationale for care plan decisions.

## ðŸ“… Timeline (Phase 1)

| Milestone | Description | Due |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| M1 | Complete PubMed ingestion and graph loading | Month 1 |
| M2 | Entity and relation extraction pipeline live | Month 1.5 |
| M3 | Protocol + outcome comparison queries built | Month 2 |
| M4 | LLM-based summarizer + recommender demo | Month 2.5 |

## ðŸ”’ Compliance & Review

- HIPAA-safe workflow: No PHI enters PubMed ingestion.
- Summarization tasks are restricted to literature and anonymized population-level queries.
- Integration with clinical decision support review team.

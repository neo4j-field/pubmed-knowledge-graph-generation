AB  - BACKGROUND: The global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes highlights the need 
      for safe and effective therapeutic interventions. Enhalus acoroides is a tropical 
      seagrass rich in carotenoids and other bioactives. Its potential for metabolic 
      regulation has been suggested in vitro, but in vivo efficacy and molecular 
      mechanisms remain unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-obesity and 
      anti-diabetic effects of Enhalus acoroides extract (SEAE) in a zebrafish model of 
      diet- and glucose-induced metabolic dysfunction. METHODS: Adult zebrafish were 
      subjected to overfeeding and glucose immersion, after overfeeding and 14 days of 
      glucose immersion to induce diabetes, adult zebrafish were randomized into three 
      groups: untreated diabetic, SEAE-treated (5 mg/L), and metformin-treated 
      (3.3 mg/L) for 20 days. Body weight, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, gene 
      expression (GLP-1, PPARgamma, SREBP-1c), and gut microbiota profiles via 16 S rRNA 
      sequencing were assessed. RESULTS: SEAE significantly reduced body weight and 
      blood glucose in diabetic zebrafish (p < 0.05), with efficacy comparable to or 
      exceeding Metformin. It upregulated GLP-1 and downregulated PPARgamma and SREBP-1c. 
      SEAE also reduced total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL levels, while 
      increasing HDL levels. Moreover, SEAE restored the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes 
      ratio, increased alpha diversity, and shifted beta diversity toward healthy 
      controls. SEAE-treated fish showed microbial profiles closer to normal than those 
      treated with Metformin. CONCLUSIONS: SEAE exhibits strong anti-obesity and 
      anti-hyperglycemic effects by modulating key metabolic pathways and restoring gut 
      microbial homeostasis. These findings highlight SEAE as a promising 
      marine-derived therapeutic candidate for metabolic syndrome and warrant further 
      investigation as a functional food or nutraceutical. CLINICAL TRIAL: Not 
      applicable.

TI  - Evaluation of bone health and fracture risk in type 2 diabetes: a network 
      meta-analysis of anti-diabetic treatments versus placebo.
LID - 10.1007/s12272-025-01552-2 [doi]
AB  - While studies have highlighted the negative effects of certain antidiabetic 
      agents, similar evidence for other antidiabetic agents remains limited. In this 
      study, we aimed to analyze bone fractures and bone mineral densities (BMDs) 
      across patients receiving antidiabetic treatments, considering both overall and 
      specific sites. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov up to March 2024 to determine the effect of antidiabetic agent 
      use on bone health in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome 
      was to reveal variations in fractures across different anti-diabetic treatment 
      modalities. The secondary outcome was the differences in BMDs based on treatment 
      type. The fractures were grouped based on the division of specific sites. We also 
      performed a subgroup analysis to identify differences between treatment types by 
      dividing the study by treatment duration. The protocol is registered 
      (CRD42024538789). A total of 234,759 individuals were enrolled in the 242 
      studies. We observed a trend wherein all anti-diabetic treatments were associated 
      with decreased risk of fracture compared with placebo; however, this was not 
      significant in direct analysis (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-1.01, I(2) = 0, P = 0.07). 
      For indirect analysis, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) 
      demonstrated a significant effect on preventing fractures in non-vertebral 
      fracture, hip fracture, vertebral and hip fracture, and overall fracture (odds 
      ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.90; OR 0.67, 95% CI 
      0.49-0.92; OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.87; OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48-0.69, respectively). 
      Additionally, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) significantly reduced 
      incidences of non-vertebral fracture, vertebral and hip fracture, and overall 
      fracture risk (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.25-0.45; OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55-0.95; OR 0.67, 95% 
      CI 0.55-0.82, respectively). Meanwhile, metformin also reduces overall fracture 
      risk (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.88). We observed no significant differences between 
      the antidiabetic agents according to the specific fracture site or study time 
      point. Most antidiabetic treatments except thiazolidinediones did not increase 
      the risk of fractures compared with the placebo. Incretin-based therapies (GLP1RA 
      and DPP4i) exerted beneficial effects on fracture prevention compared with other 
      treatments. These findings underscore the need for well-conducted RCTs to provide 
      further evidence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that 
      glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists (GLP1-ras) may offer neuroprotective 
      and cardiovascular benefits. However, concerns have been raised about potential 
      adverse effects of GLP1-ras including depression and suicidal ideation. This 
      target-trial-emulation study aims to examine the effects of GLP1-ras treatment on 
      psychiatric hospital admission and all-cause mortality in individuals with 
      schizophrenia. METHODS: We used the Danish nationwide registers to identify all 
      individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and who were treated with metformin 
      (Glucophage). Among these, we identified those who initiated second-line 
      treatment for type-2-diabetes with one of the following glucose-lowering drugs: 
      GLP1-ras, sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2-inhibitors(SGLT2is), or 
      dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-inhibitors(DPP-4is). We then compared the hazard rate 
      ratios(HRR) for psychiatric admission and all-cause mortality between the 
      different treatment arms using a Cox-proportional-hazards model, adjusting for 
      covariates to minimize confounding. RESULTS: We included 354 individuals with 
      schizophrenia(47 % female, mean age 43.8 years) and type-2-diabetes who initiated 
      treatment with a second-line GLD. Of these, 71, 197, and 86 initiated treatment 
      with GLP1-ras, DPP-4is, and SGLT2is respectively. We found no difference in the 
      risk of psychiatric admission between the three treatment arms. In the fully 
      adjusted model, treatment with DPP-4is and SGLT2is analysed as a compound 
      exposure, was not associated with a significant reduced risk of psychiatric 
      admission, with a HRR of 0.78(95 %-CI:0.38-1.59), when compared to GLP1-ras. Only 
      5 deaths occurred during follow-up, making a comparison of all-cause mortality 
      between the treatment arms unfeasible. CONCLUSION: We observed no difference in 
      the risk of psychiatric admission or all-cause mortality for individuals with 
      schizophrenia treated with GLP1-ras compared to SGLT2is and DPP-4is.

TI  - Salacia Reticulata Extract Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Glucose Homeostasis 
      by Activating Insulin Signaling and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Modulation.
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2025.k.0038 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of Salacia reticulata on glucose metabolism, 
      insulin signaling, and key metabolic markers in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We 
      evaluated how S. reticulata influences the activity of major enzymes responsible 
      for carbohydrate breakdown. In vitro studies on C2C12 cells also examined glucose 
      uptake and insulin signaling pathway activation. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima 
      Fatty (OLETF) rats were treated with S. reticulata (25 and 50 mg/kg body weight 
      [bw]) or metformin (126 mg/kg bw) for 16 weeks. S. reticulata suppressed the 
      activities of alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase while promoting insulin signaling 
      pathways and glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes. In OLETF rats, administration of 
      S. reticulata markedly enhanced glucose tolerance, lowered fasting blood glucose 
      and HbA1c levels, and significantly decreased the homeostatic model assessment 
      for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, reflecting improved insulin sensitivity. 
      Western blot analysis revealed increased insulin receptor substrate-1, PI3K, Akt, 
      and activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, along with upregulated GLUT4 
      expression in skeletal muscle. Serum glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 
      adiponectin levels were significantly elevated in the S. reticulata-treated 
      groups, helping improve insulin action and systemic metabolic regulation. As a 
      result, S. reticulata exerts beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and 
      glucose homeostasis by affecting key mechanisms such as insulin signaling, 
      incretin dynamics, and adipokine modulation, reinforcing its value as a n'atural 
      agent for treating T2D and associated metabolic issues.

TI  - Effect of Semaglutide on C-peptide levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 457-461
AB  - The study evaluated the effect of semaglutide treatment for type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM), specifically examining its effect on C-peptide levels. A total 
      of 80 patients hospitalized for T2DM were included (January 2022-December 2023), 
      and all patients had conventional treatment with oral metformin. Patients in the 
      control group received subcutaneous insulin aspart, while patients in the 
      observation group received subcutaneous semaglutide. Key variables, fasting blood 
      glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2h-PBG), and time to target 
      blood glucose, were assessed at the baseline and again after three months. Serum 
      endothelin-1 (ET-1), functional vasodilation (FMD), fasting C-peptide, fasting 
      insulin (FINS), and the insulin resistance index (Homa-IR) were also measured. At 
      the end of three months, the observation group had significantly lower 2h-PBG 
      (9.01+/-0.53 mmol/L) and FBG (6.13+/-0.68 mmol/L) than the control group (P<0.05). 
      Additionally, the time to target glucose was shorter in the observation group 
      (3.88+/-0.69 vs. 5.73+/-1.01 days, P<0.05). The observation group also had lower 
      ET-1, higher FMD, and increased Homa-IR (P<0.05). In conclusion, semaglutide 
      optimizes glycemic control, lowers insulin resistance, and increases 
      vasorelaxation function. Semaglutide has great potential as a therapeutic agent 
      in T2DM.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Data about efficacy and safety of GLP1 receptor agonists in 
      liver-transplanted patients are lacking. METHODS: Among a population of 
      liver-transplanted individuals with diabetes, we evaluated 68 patients before, 6, 
      12 and 18 months after starting a GLP1RA-based therapy, as add on to metformin or 
      insulin. We assessed glycemic control, body weight and composition (with 
      bio-impedance analysis), liver fibrosis and steatosis (with transient 
      elastography). Amylase, lipase levels and concomitant therapies were recorded at 
      basal and follow up evaluations. Patients had an e-mail contact to report any 
      adverse events. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in fasting plasma 
      glucose, HbA1c, weight, BMI, waist circumference. We demonstrated a reduction in 
      total and LDL cholesterol. Liver stiffness decreased during the first 6 months. 
      The rate of adverse events was low and the symptoms reported didn't require any 
      medical measures: 26.9% reported mild nausea, only 3 patients (7.69%) 
      discontinued the drug dose due to gastrointestinal intolerance. No pancreatitis 
      episodes were detected, amylase and lipase levels didn't increase (despite 
      concomitant calcineurin inhibitors). No adjustments in immunosuppressant therapy 
      were reported. Among the 45 patients requiring insulin when a GLP1RA therapy was 
      added on, 20 (33.2%) and 31 (45.5%) could suspend insulin therapy at, 
      respectively, 6 and 18 months. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, GLP1RA-based therapy 
      can be considered safe and effective in a short-term follow up in 
      liver-transplanted patients. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of 
      this drugs on long term complications, such as renal impairment, cardiovascular 
      events and all-cause mortality.

TI  - The potential biomarker value of soluble CD36 in the treatment of diabetic kidney

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soluble CD36 (sCD36), the circulating form of the scavenger receptor 
      CD36, plays a key role in lipid accumulation and inflammation during the 
      progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and has been proposed as a 
      promising non-invasive biomarker. The renoprotective effects of glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may involve modulation of sCD36. This 
      study aimed to evaluate the impact of GLP-1RA and insulin treatment on sCD36 
      levels and their association with renal function in DKD patients. METHODS: This 
      single-center, prospective observational cohort study enrolled 191 patients with 
      type 2 diabetes and early-stage DKD, who were stratified into three groups based 
      on treatment regimen: control group (n = 63), insulin group (n = 71), and GLP-1RA 
      group (n = 57). All patients received standard care with metformin, with the 
      insulin and GLP-1RA groups receiving additional respective treatments for 12 
      weeks. Clinical parameters including sCD36, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
      (UACR), lipid profile, glycemic markers, and islet function indices were assessed 
      at baseline and post-treatment. Intra- and inter-group comparisons were performed 
      using paired tests and analysis of covariance. Generalized linear regression 
      models were applied to assess the relationship between sCD36 and renal function. 
      RESULTS: Baseline sCD36 and UACR levels were comparable across the three groups 
      (P > 0.05). After 12 weeks, sCD36 levels significantly declined in the GLP-1RA 
      group (median: 195.20 ng/mL, IQR: 160.45-314.75), compared to the insulin group 
      (364.60 ng/mL, IQR: 279.10-394.10) and control group (386.10 ng/mL, IQR: 
      323.60-471.30) (P < 0.001). The GLP-1RA group also showed the most marked 
      reduction in UACR (P < 0.001). Regression analysis demonstrated a significant 
      positive association between sCD36 and UACR levels both before and after 
      treatment (P < 0.001), and the change in sCD36 (DeltasCD36) was positively correlated 
      with the improvement in UACR, suggesting a link to reduced renal lipotoxicity and 
      inflammation. CONCLUSION: GLP-1RAs significantly reduce sCD36 and UACR levels in 
      patients with early DKD, outperforming insulin in renoprotection. These findings 
      raise the possibility that GLP-1RAs may exert renoprotective effects through 
      modulation of CD36-related pathways, although direct mechanistic validation was 
      not performed in this study.sCD36 may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring 
      DKD progression and therapeutic response, though further multicenter and 
      long-term studies are needed to confirm its clinical utility.

AB  - Anemia is a common yet often overlooked complication in patients with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly those with chronic kidney disease. It 
      significantly impacts patients' quality of life, cardiovascular health, and 
      treatment outcomes. Despite its high prevalence, current clinical guidelines lack 
      specific recommendations for anemia prevention and management in T2DM, especially 
      in the context of newer antidiabetic therapies. This review explores the 
      potential of emerging antidiabetic medications, such as sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 
      RAs), and combined GLP-1-RA/GIP to mitigate anemia risk. Early detection and 
      management of anemia in T2DM patients are crucial for improving glycemic control, 
      reducing cardiovascular morbidity, and enhancing overall treatment outcomes. This 
      review underscores the need for further research to better understand the 
      mechanisms by which these novel therapies influence anemia risk and to integrate 
      these findings into clinical practice.

TI  - Risk and Protective Factors for Ocular Surface Disease in Patients with Type 2 
      Diabetic Mellitus: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - 10.1089/jop.2024.0175 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Identify the risk and protective factors for ocular surface disease 
      (OSD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: This 
      retrospective cohort study used the Chang Gung Research Database (2005-2020) for 
      patients with T2DM. A total of 161,001 patients were included, of which 915 had 
      OSD and 160,086 did not. The OSD group was further divided into recurrent corneal 
      erosion (RCE) (n = 92) and corneal ulcer (n = 371) groups after excluding those 
      with overlapping diagnoses. The risk and protective factors were also analyzed. 
      Results: After age and gender matching, the OSD group had a considerably higher 
      baseline and mean HbA1c and a higher incidence of dry eye disease (DED), diabetic 
      neuropathy, retinopathy, and ocular procedures. After adjusting for gender, age, 
      and diabetes mellitus (DM) duration, we found that DED, higher mean HbA1c, 
      diabetic neuropathy, trans pars plana vitrectomy (TPPV) and cataract surgery were 
      the contributing factors for OSD. Antihyperglycemic agents, especially 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, 
      considerably protect against OSD. DED and TPPV were risk factors for corneal 
      ulcers but not for RCE; however, DM medication had the same effect on corneal 
      ulcers and RCE. Conclusions: Poor diabetic control, diabetic neuropathy, and 
      ocular procedures are the risk factors for OSD. Antihyperglycemic agents, except 
      metformin, can prevent OSD in patients with T2DM. Additionally, DED and TPPV are 
      risk factors for corneal ulcers but not for RCE. A prospective randomized 
      controlled trial is required to confirm our results.

LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2025.05.003 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to understand real-world use of 
      Tirzepatide among people without type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnoses in the United 
      States in the Merative(TM) MarketScan(R) Commercial (MarketScan) and Optum 
      Clinformatics Claims (CDM) databases. METHODS: This retrospective, observational, 
      descriptive study used data from the MarketScan and Optum CDM databases (index 
      date: first-observed Tirzepatide claim) from May 2021 to September 2023. Key 
      eligibility criteria included age >/=18 years, >/=1 Tirzepatide claim, no baseline 
      T2D diagnosis codes or antihyperglycemic medication use (except metformin), and 
      continuous medical and pharmacy enrollment for >/=12 months pre-index. Demographic 
      characteristics were assessed at the index date, while clinical characteristics 
      and treatment-related data were identified during the 12-month pre-index period. 
      Tirzepatide persistence and utilization (6 months post index) were assessed for 
      individuals with >/=6 months of follow-up after initiation of Tirzepatide treatment 
      (index date). Data were analyzed separately for each database. FINDINGS: Overall, 
      15,534 eligible adults were identified in the MarketScan database and 6800 in the 
      Optum CDM database; mean age was 46.2 years and 55.9 years, respectively, and in 
      both databases, >70% were female. A total of 70.6% (MarketScan) and 81.0% (Optum 
      CDM) of individuals had at least one obesity-related complication, with the most 
      prevalent being hypertension, dyslipidemia, and pre-diabetes. There were 8709 
      individuals in the MarketScan database and 3384 in the Optum CDM database with >/=6 
      months of follow-up. In both databases, approximately two-thirds of people were 
      started on 2.5 mg and, by the sixth prescription fill, the most common doses of 
      Tirzepatide were 5 mg and 7.5 mg. Tirzepatide persistence ranged from 60.6% to 
      75.7% across both databases, with an allowed gap between prescriptions of 45 days 
      or 60 days. Of individuals who discontinued tirzepatide, 10.2-19.5% restarted 
      Tirzepatide during the 6-month follow-up. IMPLICATIONS: In both databases, most 
      people initiating Tirzepatide without T2D diagnoses had >/=1 obesity-related 
      complication, indicating that Tirzepatide is being used in people with 
      multimorbidity. A high proportion of people who initiated Tirzepatide were 
      persistent on treatment at 6 months, which is higher than that previously 
      reported for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are 
      antihyperglycemic agents used to control type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      Recently, there has been increased recognition of the potential pulmonary 
      protective effects of GLP-1RA. Given the bidirectional association between T2DM 
      and obstructive lung disease (OLD) incidence and progression, our systematic 
      review aimed to determine if GLP-1RA therapy for comorbid T2DM was associated 
      with a decreased risk of asthma and COPD exacerbations, relative to other T2DM 
      treatments. METHODS: We systematically searched for English-language articles 
      published in Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases from 
      inception to June 25, 2024. Random effects meta-analysis was used to aggregate 
      data where feasible. RESULTS: Of 23 full-text manuscripts considered for 
      inclusion, six retrospective observational studies were selected (total 
      N = 62,678). The pooled incidence rate ratios (IRR) of asthma or COPD 
      exacerbations demonstrated a statistically significant lower risk of 
      exacerbations associated with GLP-1RA compared to sulfonylureas (IRR, 95 %CI: 
      0.52, 0.42-0.64) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4I) (IRR 0.63, 
      0.47-0.86), but not sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2I) (IRR 0.66, 
      0.21-2.05). The risk of exacerbations rate was also lower in GLP-1RA users 
      relative to insulin in a single study (IRR 0.39, 0.26-0.58) and higher compared 
      to metformin in a single Japanese cohort (IRR 1.24, 1.08-1.43). CONCLUSION: Our 
      systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence for a reduced risk for 
      asthma and COPD exacerbations associated with GLP-1RA use in adults with OLD and 
      T2DM, relative to sulfonylureas or DPP-4I medications. Future research should 
      focus on confirming our observed relationships in prospective trials.

TI  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and gastrointestinal cancer risk in 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes.
LID - 10.1007/s00125-025-06453-z [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
      (GLP-1RAs) have been demonstrated in treatment of type 2 diabetes and weight 
      management, their potential role in cancer prevention remains inadequately 
      explored. METHODS: Using the TriNetX Research Network, we conducted a 
      retrospective cohort study comparing new users of GLP-1RAs with users of other 
      glucose-lowering medications. Propensity score matching was performed for 
      demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, family history, lifestyle factors and 
      cancer risk factors. The primary outcome was the incidence of obesity-related 
      gastrointestinal cancers, and secondary outcomes were the incidence of individual 
      cancer types. RESULTS: Using adjusted HRs (aHRs), GLP-1RA use was found to be 
      associated with a significantly lower risk of overall gastrointestinal cancer 
      compared with all other glucose-lowering medications (insulin: aHR 0.29; 95% CI 
      0.23, 0.37; metformin: aHR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71, 0.99; sulfonylureas: aHR 0.71; 95% 
      CI 0.62, 0.80; thiazolidinediones: aHR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74, 0.99; dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 inhibitors: aHR 0.80; 95% CI 0.70, 0.91; sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter-2 inhibitors: aHR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68, 0.96). The protective effect 
      was most pronounced compared with insulin therapy, with significant risk 
      reductions across all individual cancers. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: GLP-1RA use 
      is associated with a reduced risk of gastrointestinal cancers in individuals with 
      type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest potential cancer-protective benefits of 
      GLP-1RAs beyond their established roles in glycaemic management and weight 
      reduction.

TI  - Risk of Thyroid Tumors With GLP-1 Receptor Agonists: A Retrospective Cohort 
      Study.
LID - dc250154 [pii]
LID - 10.2337/dc25-0154 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor 
      agonist (GLP-1RA) use and risk of incident thyroid tumors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
      METHODS: The retrospective, active-comparator new-user cohort study used 
      international administrative claims and electronic health record databases. 
      Participants included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with prior 
      metformin therapy initiating a GLP-1RA versus new users of sodium-glucose 
      cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors 
      (DPP-4is), and sulfonylureas (SUs). The outcome was incident thyroid tumor and 
      thyroid malignancy. Propensity score matching and stratification were used to 
      adjust for confounders with an intention-to-treat and on-treatment strategy. Cox 
      regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) pooled using a random-effects 
      meta-analysis. Unmeasured confounding was evaluated using negative outcomes, with 
      calibration of the HR. RESULTS: A total of 460,032 users of GLP-1RAs, 717,792 
      users of SGLT2is, 2,055,583 users of DPP-4is, and 1,119,868 users of SUs were 
      included. Only U.S. cohorts passed study diagnostics. Thyroid tumor incidence 
      ranged from 0.88 to 1.03 per 1,000 person-years in GLP-1RA cohorts. GLP-1RA 
      exposure was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid tumors compared 
      with SGLT2is, DPP-4is, or SUs (meta-analysis: GLP-1RA vs. SGLT2i HR range from 
      0.83 [95% CI 0.57-1.27] to 0.95 [0.85-1.06]; GLP-1RA vs. SU HR range from 0.95 
      [0.75-1.20] to 1.03 [0.87-1.23]; GLP-1RA vs. DPP-4i HR range from 0.78 
      [0.60-1.01] to 0.93 [0.83-1.04]). Analysis using thyroid malignancy and including 
      a 1-year lag period produced similar conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      T2DM initiating second-line treatments, we observed no increased risk of thyroid 
      tumors with GLP-1RA exposure.

AB  - AIMS: In patients with new onset type 2 diabetes, this study aimed to analyze 
      glucose-lowering medication use patterns between 2014 and 2022. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This retrospective study included adults with incident type 2 diabetes 
      in the University of California Health System between 2014 and 2022. We 
      determined medications used within 1 year of diagnosis and evaluated statistical 
      evidence of use pattern changes via Mann-Kendall trend tests. Four categories of 
      high-risk patients requiring cardio-kidney-metabolic protection were also 
      evaluated in stratified analyses based on 2024 ADA guidelines. RESULTS: Of 40 150 
      patients with incident type 2 diabetes, 38.5% initiated glucose-lowering 
      medication within 1 year. Metformin remained the most used medication from 2014 
      to 2022. From 2014 to 2022, usage of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 
      inhibitors increased exponentially. GLP-1 receptor agonist use increased from 
      below 2.5%-21%. While SGLT-2 inhibitor use increased from less than 2.5%-14%. 
      This growth coincided with a decline in sulfonylurea usage. Among high-risk, 
      insulin was most prevalent in those with heart failure or chronic kidney disease. 
      However, usage of insulin declined overall in all groups. Utilization of SGLT-2 
      inhibitors was particularly high in patients with prior heart failure. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In adults with new onset type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 receptor agonist and 
      SGLT-2 inhibitor utilization has markedly increased, coordinating with evolving 
      guidelines that emphasize cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease management. 
      However, overall adoption rates of these medications remain low based on 
      indicated populations. Sulfonylurea use declined while metformin remains the most 
      frequently initiated treatment.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting over 
      90% of diabetes patients worldwide. The condition is driven by genetic 
      predispositions, environmental factors, obesity, and physical inactivity. 
      Pharmacological treatments range from metformin to newer agents, including GLP-1 
      analogues and SGLT-2 inhibitors, which target different aspects of glucose 
      metabolism. The review highlights advancements in clinical trials for T2DM 
      treatments, focusing on recent and ongoing research. Clinical trial data were 
      sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov, and the search criteria focused on trials that 
      were published with monotherapy of T2DM having results within the last six years, 
      specifically from 2019 to 2024. The clinical trials of the patients under the age 
      group of adults (18 to 64 years) and older adults (>64 years) were included. The 
      data are mentioned in inverse chronological order with respect to study duration. 
      The clinical trial data suggest promising results in managing hemoglobin A1c and 
      body weight. However, adverse events such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, 
      and bone-related issues and other issues such as diabetic ketoacidosis and 
      pancreatitis were reported in some cases. Dulaglutide, tripeptide, and oral 
      insulin showed promising therapeutic effects in clinical trials. Despite 
      significant progress, the management of T2DM remains challenging, emphasizing the 
      need for ongoing innovation in treatment approaches to improve patient quality of 
      life and reduce the global burden of the disease.

TI  - Impact of Antidepressants on Weight Gain: Underlying Mechanisms and Mitigation 
      Strategies.
PG  - 183-195
AB  - Antidepressants are widely prescribed for major depressive disorder and anxiety, 
      yet their long-term use is associated with weight gain, affecting up to 55-65% of 
      patients. This adverse effect contributes to treatment discontinuation, relapse, 
      and worsened metabolic health outcomes, including increased risk for obesity and 
      type 2 diabetes. This artic le presents a critical evaluation of the published 
      reports on the mechanisms underlying antidepressant-induced weight gain, 
      comparative effects across drug classes, and mitigation strategies. Weight gain 
      varies significantly by antidepressant class. Tricyclic antidepressants, 
      monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and a tetracyclic antidepressant, mirtazapine, are 
      associated with the most substantial weight increases, while selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors typically induce weight gain after prolonged use. Mechanisms 
      involve serotonergic and dopaminergic signaling, receptor desensitization, 
      insulin resistance, and altered leptin and ghrelin levels. Genetic factors, 
      including CYP2C19 metabolizer status, and lifestyle factors such as baseline body 
      mass index and diet, further influence risk. Bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine 
      reuptake inhibitor, is the only commonly prescribed antidepressant consistently 
      associated with weight loss or neutrality. Mitigation strategies include 
      switching medications, adding agents like metformin or GLP-1 receptor agonists, 
      and incorporating behavioral interventions. Antidepressant-induced weight gain is 
      a multifactorial issue requiring individualized management. Understanding 
      pharmacologic mechanisms and patient-specific risk factors is essential for 
      optimizing treatment efficacy while minimizing metabolic burden.

TI  - Association of novel antihyperglycaemic drugs versus metformin with COPD 
      exacerbations.
LID - 00757-2024 [pii]
LID - 10.1183/23120541.00757-2024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 Is), glucagon-like peptidase 
      1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors 
      (SGLT-2 Is) may contribute to better control of COPD due to their 
      anti-inflammatory effects, like those observed with metformin. We aimed to 
      investigate the association of these novel antihyperglycaemic drugs versus 
      metformin with fewer COPD exacerbations in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) 
      comorbid with COPD. METHODS: Using the national administrative database covering 
      99% of the medical facilities in Japan, we constructed three active comparators 
      new-user cohorts comprising 36 317 patients with T2DM and COPD who initiated 
      treatment with the novel antihyperglycaemic drugs and metformin between 2014 and 
      2022. Patients' backgrounds were balanced using overlap propensity score 
      weighting. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) for the initial occurrence of COPD exacerbation requiring 
      systemic corticosteroids using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model. 
      RESULTS: DPP-4 Is were associated with a higher incidence of exacerbations 
      requiring systemic corticosteroids (22.4 versus 20.4 per 100 person-years; HR 
      1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.25) compared with metformin. In contrast, the incidence of 
      such exacerbations in the GLP-1 RAs (30.1 versus 24.4 per 100 person-years; HR 
      1.07, 95% CI 0.87-1.32) and SGLT-2 Is (20.7 versus 21.8 per 100 person-years; HR 
      1.00, 95% CI 0.94-1.06) groups were comparable with that in the metformin group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: While DPP-4 Is were associated with poorer control of COPD compared 
      with metformin, GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 Is offered COPD control comparable with that 
      of metformin.

TI  - Exploring the Protective Effects of Traditional Antidiabetic Medications and 
      Novel Antihyperglycemic Agents in Diabetic Rodent Models.
LID - 10.3390/ph18050670 [doi]
LID - 670
AB  - Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder that affects multiple 
      organs, leading to severe complications in the pancreas, kidneys, liver, and 
      heart. Prolonged hyperglycemia, along with oxidative stress and chronic 
      inflammation, plays a crucial role in accelerating tissue damage, significantly 
      increasing the risk of diabetic complications such as nephropathy, hepatopathy, 
      and cardiovascular disease. This review evaluates the protective effects of 
      various antidiabetic treatments on organ tissues affected by T2D, based on 
      findings from experimental animal models. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic 
      agent, has been widely recognized for its ability to reduce inflammation and 
      oxidative stress, thereby mitigating diabetes-induced organ damage. Its 
      protective role extends beyond glucose regulation, offering benefits such as 
      improved mitochondrial function and reduced fibrosis in affected tissues. In 
      addition to traditional therapies, new classes of antidiabetic drugs, including 
      sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
      receptor agonists not only improve glycemic control but also exhibit 
      nephroprotective and cardioprotective properties by reducing glomerular 
      hyperfiltration, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Similarly, GLP-1 receptor 
      agonists have been associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and enhanced 
      cardiovascular function. Preclinical studies suggest that tirzepatide, a dual 
      GLP-1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor agonist may offer superior 
      metabolic benefits compared to conventional GLP-1 agonists by improving beta-cell 
      function, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and reducing fatty liver progression. 
      Despite promising preclinical results, differences between animal models and 
      human physiology pose a challenge. Further clinical research is needed to confirm 
      these effects and refine treatment strategies. Future T2D management aims to go 
      beyond glycemic control, emphasizing organ protection and long-term disease 
      prevention.

AB  - Systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that dietary interventions and 
      metabolic surgery lead to higher rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission, 
      improving beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. There is limited data on 
      the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions targeting T2D remission. We 
      aimed to search clinical trial registries and perform a systematic mapping of 
      registered randomized clinical trials of pharmacological interventions targeting 
      T2D remission; summarizing the existing research space, and identifying gaps for 
      future research. We searched three clinical trial registries: Clinicaltrials.gov, 
      the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and 
      the European Union Clinical Trials Information System on the 19th March 2024. Key 
      outcomes included sample size, interventions, comparators, definition of T2D 
      remission, follow-up duration, funding source, eligibility criteria, trial 
      completion status, publication status, and availability of published results. The 
      search yielded 1108 results, of which 34 trials were included. The majority were 
      non-industry funded (70.6%, n = 24) and 88.2% (n = 30) of trials targeted 
      remission of T2D diagnosed within 6 years. Approximately 56% (n = 19) of trials 
      used pharmacological combination therapy with mainly metformin, insulin, and a 
      glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist. The majority of studies (35.3%, n = 12) 
      did not register defined specific criteria to determine remission and there was a 
      lack of consistency in methods of beta-cell function measurement. We suggest that 
      future research use a standardized definition of T2D remission and the beta-cell 
      function method. Future trials should focus on using GLP-1 receptor agonists and 
      GIP analogs, and their role in weight loss and T2D.Registration: PROSPERO

TI  - Insulin resistance: The role in comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus and depression.
PG  - 106218

AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of 
      comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and depression (CDD) through 
      multifaceted mechanisms, including dysregulation of insulin signaling (both 
      central and peripheral), neuroendocrine disturbances 
      (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and monoaminergic 
      neurotransmission impairment), chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, disruption 
      of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
      levels, and altered synaptic plasticity. These IR-related pathways may predispose 
      individuals to depressive symptoms or exacerbate existing mood disorders. A 
      comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is critical for developing 
      integrated therapeutic strategies that concurrently target metabolic and 
      psychiatric dysfunction. Antidepressant medications exhibit divergent effects on 
      glucose metabolism. Tricyclic antidepressants, particularly amitriptyline and 
      nortriptyline, worsen metabolic profiles by exacerbating IR, promoting weight 
      gain, and inducing hyperglycemia, thereby increasing diabetes risk with prolonged 
      use. Consequently, tricyclic antidepressants should be avoided in metabolically 
      vulnerable populations unless alternatives are unavailable. Mirtazapine presents 
      a paradoxical profile-while its appetite-stimulating effects often lead to weight 
      gain (a known IR risk factor), some evidence suggests potential beta-cell function 
      preservation, necessitating cautious use of mirtazapine in individuals with 
      metabolic syndrome. Among selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine and 
      escitalopram demonstrate favorable metabolic effects, including improved insulin 
      sensitivity and glycemic control, though hypoglycemia risk (particularly with 
      concomitant sulfonylureas) warrants monitoring. Bupropion, a 
      norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, uniquely promotes weight loss and 
      enhances glycemic control, making it a preferred option for depression comorbid 
      with obesity or T2DM. Agomelatine, with its neutral metabolic profile and 
      circadian rhythm-modulating properties, represents a safer alternative for 
      patients with metabolic concerns. Concurrently, certain antidiabetic agents show 
      promise in managing depression. Metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
      inhibitors may be prioritized for diabetic patients at risk for depression, while 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists appear particularly beneficial for 
      obesity-related mood disturbances. Thiazolidinediones offer value in 
      treatment-resistant cases, whereas insulin secretagogues should be used 
      cautiously in psychiatrically vulnerable individuals. Future research should 
      prioritize three key directions: (1) Mechanistic investigations using advanced 
      neuroimaging to elucidate the contribution of IR to depressive phenotypes and 
      evaluate novel interventions (such as intranasal insulin); (2) Precision medicine 
      approaches incorporating biomarkers, including genetic polymorphisms, 
      inflammatory markers, and gut microbiome signatures, to optimize antidepressant 
      selection and develop personalized treatment algorithms; and (3) Therapeutic 
      innovation, including dual GLP-1/GIP agonists and 
      anti-inflammatory-antidepressant combinations, as well as integrating digital 
      health technologies (e.g., continuous glucose monitoring coupled with mood 
      tracking), will enable real-time, data-driven management. These advances will be 
      instrumental in establishing integrated care paradigms for this comorbidity, 
      which intertwines metabolic and psychiatric conditions.

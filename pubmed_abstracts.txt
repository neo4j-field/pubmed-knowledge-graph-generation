BACKGROUND: The global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes highlights the need 
for safe and effective therapeutic interventions. Enhalus acoroides is a 
tropical seagrass rich in carotenoids and other bioactives. Its potential for 
metabolic regulation has been suggested in vitro, but in vivo efficacy and 
molecular mechanisms remain unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the 
anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of Enhalus acoroides extract (SEAE) in a 
zebrafish model of diet- and glucose-induced metabolic dysfunction.
METHODS: Adult zebrafish were subjected to overfeeding and glucose immersion, 
after overfeeding and 14 days of glucose immersion to induce diabetes, adult 
zebrafish were randomized into three groups: untreated diabetic, SEAE-treated 
(5 mg/L), and metformin-treated (3.3 mg/L) for 20 days. Body weight, fasting 
blood glucose, lipid profile, gene expression (GLP-1, PPARγ, SREBP-1c), and gut 
microbiota profiles via 16 S rRNA sequencing were assessed.
RESULTS: SEAE significantly reduced body weight and blood glucose in diabetic 
zebrafish (p < 0.05), with efficacy comparable to or exceeding Metformin. It 
upregulated GLP-1 and downregulated PPARγ and SREBP-1c. SEAE also reduced total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL levels, while increasing HDL levels. 
Moreover, SEAE restored the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, increased alpha 
diversity, and shifted beta diversity toward healthy controls. SEAE-treated fish 
showed microbial profiles closer to normal than those treated with Metformin.
CONCLUSIONS: SEAE exhibits strong anti-obesity and anti-hyperglycemic effects by 
modulating key metabolic pathways and restoring gut microbial homeostasis. These 
findings highlight SEAE as a promising marine-derived therapeutic candidate for 
metabolic syndrome and warrant further investigation as a functional food or 
nutraceutical.

While studies have highlighted the negative effects of certain antidiabetic 
agents, similar evidence for other antidiabetic agents remains limited. In this 
study, we aimed to analyze bone fractures and bone mineral densities (BMDs) 
across patients receiving antidiabetic treatments, considering both overall and 
specific sites. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and 
ClinicalTrials.gov up to March 2024 to determine the effect of antidiabetic 
agent use on bone health in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary 
outcome was to reveal variations in fractures across different anti-diabetic 
treatment modalities. The secondary outcome was the differences in BMDs based on 
treatment type. The fractures were grouped based on the division of specific 
sites. We also performed a subgroup analysis to identify differences between 
treatment types by dividing the study by treatment duration. The protocol is 
registered (CRD42024538789). A total of 234,759 individuals were enrolled in the 
242 studies. We observed a trend wherein all anti-diabetic treatments were 
associated with decreased risk of fracture compared with placebo; however, this 
was not significant in direct analysis (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-1.01, I2 = 0, 
P = 0.07). For indirect analysis, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP1RAs) demonstrated a significant effect on preventing fractures in 
non-vertebral fracture, hip fracture, vertebral and hip fracture, and overall 
fracture (odds ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.90; OR 0.67, 
95% CI 0.49-0.92; OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.87; OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.48-0.69, 
respectively). Additionally, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) 
significantly reduced incidences of non-vertebral fracture, vertebral and hip 
fracture, and overall fracture risk (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.25-0.45; OR 0.72, 95% CI 
0.55-0.95; OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.82, respectively). Meanwhile, metformin also 
reduces overall fracture risk (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42-0.88). We observed no 
significant differences between the antidiabetic agents according to the 
specific fracture site or study time point. Most antidiabetic treatments except 
thiazolidinediones did not increase the risk of fractures compared with the 
placebo. Incretin-based therapies (GLP1RA and DPP4i) exerted beneficial effects 
on fracture prevention compared with other treatments. These findings underscore 
the need for well-conducted RCTs to provide further evidence.

OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested that 
glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists (GLP1-ras) may offer neuroprotective 
and cardiovascular benefits. However, concerns have been raised about potential 
adverse effects of GLP1-ras including depression and suicidal ideation. This 
target-trial-emulation study aims to examine the effects of GLP1-ras treatment 
on psychiatric hospital admission and all-cause mortality in individuals with 
schizophrenia.
METHODS: We used the Danish nationwide registers to identify all individuals 
diagnosed with schizophrenia and who were treated with metformin (Glucophage). 
Among these, we identified those who initiated second-line treatment for 
type-2-diabetes with one of the following glucose-lowering drugs: GLP1-ras, 
sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2-inhibitors(SGLT2is), or 
dipeptidyl-peptidase-4-inhibitors(DPP-4is). We then compared the hazard rate 
ratios(HRR) for psychiatric admission and all-cause mortality between the 
different treatment arms using a Cox-proportional-hazards model, adjusting for 
covariates to minimize confounding.
RESULTS: We included 354 individuals with schizophrenia(47 % female, mean age 
43.8 years) and type-2-diabetes who initiated treatment with a second-line GLD. 
Of these, 71, 197, and 86 initiated treatment with GLP1-ras, DPP-4is, and 
SGLT2is respectively. We found no difference in the risk of psychiatric 
admission between the three treatment arms. In the fully adjusted model, 
treatment with DPP-4is and SGLT2is analysed as a compound exposure, was not 
associated with a significant reduced risk of psychiatric admission, with a HRR 
of 0.78(95 %-CI:0.38-1.59), when compared to GLP1-ras. Only 5 deaths occurred 
during follow-up, making a comparison of all-cause mortality between the 
treatment arms unfeasible.
CONCLUSION: We observed no difference in the risk of psychiatric admission or 
all-cause mortality for individuals with schizophrenia treated with GLP1-ras 
compared to SGLT2is and DPP-4is.

This study evaluated the effects of Salacia reticulata on glucose metabolism, 
insulin signaling, and key metabolic markers in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We 
evaluated how S. reticulata influences the activity of major enzymes responsible 
for carbohydrate breakdown. In vitro studies on C2C12 cells also examined 
glucose uptake and insulin signaling pathway activation. Otsuka Long-Evans 
Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were treated with S. reticulata (25 and 50 mg/kg 
body weight [bw]) or metformin (126 mg/kg bw) for 16 weeks. S. reticulata 
suppressed the activities of α-glucosidase and α-amylase while promoting insulin 
signaling pathways and glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes. In OLETF rats, 
administration of S. reticulata markedly enhanced glucose tolerance, lowered 
fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels, and significantly decreased the 
homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, reflecting 
improved insulin sensitivity. Western blot analysis revealed increased insulin 
receptor substrate-1, PI3K, Akt, and activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
phosphorylation, along with upregulated GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle. 
Serum glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and adiponectin levels were significantly 
elevated in the S. reticulata-treated groups, helping improve insulin action and 
systemic metabolic regulation. As a result, S. reticulata exerts beneficial 
effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis by affecting key 
mechanisms such as insulin signaling, incretin dynamics, and adipokine 
modulation, reinforcing its value as a n'atural agent for treating T2D and 
associated metabolic issues.

Fan P(1), Ma X(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Endocrinology, Tianshui Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, 
Tianshui, Gansu China.

The study evaluated the effect of semaglutide treatment for type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), specifically examining its effect on C-peptide levels. A total 
of 80 patients hospitalized for T2DM were included (January 2022-December 2023), 
and all patients had conventional treatment with oral metformin. Patients in the 
control group received subcutaneous insulin aspart, while patients in the 
observation group received subcutaneous semaglutide. Key variables, fasting 
blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2h-PBG), and time to 
target blood glucose, were assessed at the baseline and again after three 
months. Serum endothelin-1 (ET-1), functional vasodilation (FMD), fasting 
C-peptide, fasting insulin (FINS), and the insulin resistance index (Homa-IR) 
were also measured. At the end of three months, the observation group had 
significantly lower 2h-PBG (9.01±0.53 mmol/L) and FBG (6.13±0.68 mmol/L) than 
the control group (P<0.05). Additionally, the time to target glucose was shorter 
in the observation group (3.88±0.69 vs. 5.73±1.01 days, P<0.05). The observation 
group also had lower ET-1, higher FMD, and increased Homa-IR (P<0.05). In 
conclusion, semaglutide optimizes glycemic control, lowers insulin resistance, 
and increases vasorelaxation function. Semaglutide has great potential as a 
therapeutic agent in T2DM.

INTRODUCTION: Data about efficacy and safety of GLP1 receptor agonists in 
liver-transplanted patients are lacking.
METHODS: Among a population of liver-transplanted individuals with diabetes, we 
evaluated 68 patients before, 6, 12 and 18 months after starting a GLP1RA-based 
therapy, as add on to metformin or insulin. We assessed glycemic control, body 
weight and composition (with bio-impedance analysis), liver fibrosis and 
steatosis (with transient elastography). Amylase, lipase levels and concomitant 
therapies were recorded at basal and follow up evaluations. Patients had an 
e-mail contact to report any adverse events.
RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, 
weight, BMI, waist circumference. We demonstrated a reduction in total and LDL 
cholesterol. Liver stiffness decreased during the first 6 months. The rate of 
adverse events was low and the symptoms reported didn't require any medical 
measures: 26.9% reported mild nausea, only 3 patients (7.69%) discontinued the 
drug dose due to gastrointestinal intolerance. No pancreatitis episodes were 
detected, amylase and lipase levels didn't increase (despite concomitant 
calcineurin inhibitors). No adjustments in immunosuppressant therapy were 
reported. Among the 45 patients requiring insulin when a GLP1RA therapy was 
added on, 20 (33.2%) and 31 (45.5%) could suspend insulin therapy at, 
respectively, 6 and 18 months.
DISCUSSION: In conclusion, GLP1RA-based therapy can be considered safe and 
effective in a short-term follow up in liver-transplanted patients. Further 
studies are needed to assess the effects of this drugs on long term 
complications, such as renal impairment, cardiovascular events and all-cause 
mortality.

The potential biomarker value of soluble CD36 in the treatment of diabetic 
kidney disease: evidence from GLP-1 and insulin interventions.

University, Qingdao, China.

BACKGROUND: Soluble CD36 (sCD36), the circulating form of the scavenger receptor 
CD36, plays a key role in lipid accumulation and inflammation during the 
progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and has been proposed as a 
promising non-invasive biomarker. The renoprotective effects of glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may involve modulation of sCD36. This 
study aimed to evaluate the impact of GLP-1RA and insulin treatment on sCD36 
levels and their association with renal function in DKD patients.
METHODS: This single-center, prospective observational cohort study enrolled 191 
patients with type 2 diabetes and early-stage DKD, who were stratified into 
three groups based on treatment regimen: control group (n = 63), insulin group 
(n = 71), and GLP-1RA group (n = 57). All patients received standard care with 
metformin, with the insulin and GLP-1RA groups receiving additional respective 
treatments for 12 weeks. Clinical parameters including sCD36, urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), lipid profile, glycemic markers, and islet 
function indices were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. Intra- and 
inter-group comparisons were performed using paired tests and analysis of 
covariance. Generalized linear regression models were applied to assess the 
relationship between sCD36 and renal function.
RESULTS: Baseline sCD36 and UACR levels were comparable across the three groups 
(P > 0.05). After 12 weeks, sCD36 levels significantly declined in the GLP-1RA 
group (median: 195.20 ng/mL, IQR: 160.45-314.75), compared to the insulin group 
(364.60 ng/mL, IQR: 279.10-394.10) and control group (386.10 ng/mL, IQR: 
323.60-471.30) (P < 0.001). The GLP-1RA group also showed the most marked 
reduction in UACR (P < 0.001). Regression analysis demonstrated a significant 
positive association between sCD36 and UACR levels both before and after 
treatment (P < 0.001), and the change in sCD36 (ΔsCD36) was positively 
correlated with the improvement in UACR, suggesting a link to reduced renal 
lipotoxicity and inflammation.
CONCLUSION: GLP-1RAs significantly reduce sCD36 and UACR levels in patients with 
early DKD, outperforming insulin in renoprotection. These findings raise the 
possibility that GLP-1RAs may exert renoprotective effects through modulation of 
CD36-related pathways, although direct mechanistic validation was not performed 
in this study.sCD36 may serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring DKD 
progression and therapeutic response, though further multicenter and long-term 
studies are needed to confirm its clinical utility.

Anemia is a common yet often overlooked complication in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly those with chronic kidney disease. It 
significantly impacts patients' quality of life, cardiovascular health, and 
treatment outcomes. Despite its high prevalence, current clinical guidelines 
lack specific recommendations for anemia prevention and management in T2DM, 
especially in the context of newer antidiabetic therapies. This review explores 
the potential of emerging antidiabetic medications, such as sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 
RAs), and combined GLP-1-RA/GIP to mitigate anemia risk. Early detection and 
management of anemia in T2DM patients are crucial for improving glycemic 
control, reducing cardiovascular morbidity, and enhancing overall treatment 
outcomes. This review underscores the need for further research to better 
understand the mechanisms by which these novel therapies influence anemia risk 
and to integrate these findings into clinical practice.

Purpose: Identify the risk and protective factors for ocular surface disease 
(OSD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: This 
retrospective cohort study used the Chang Gung Research Database (2005-2020) for 
patients with T2DM. A total of 161,001 patients were included, of which 915 had 
OSD and 160,086 did not. The OSD group was further divided into recurrent 
corneal erosion (RCE) (n = 92) and corneal ulcer (n = 371) groups after 
excluding those with overlapping diagnoses. The risk and protective factors were 
also analyzed. Results: After age and gender matching, the OSD group had a 
considerably higher baseline and mean HbA1c and a higher incidence of dry eye 
disease (DED), diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, and ocular procedures. After 
adjusting for gender, age, and diabetes mellitus (DM) duration, we found that 
DED, higher mean HbA1c, diabetic neuropathy, trans pars plana vitrectomy (TPPV) 
and cataract surgery were the contributing factors for OSD. Antihyperglycemic 
agents, especially sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like 
peptide-1 agonists, considerably protect against OSD. DED and TPPV were risk 
factors for corneal ulcers but not for RCE; however, DM medication had the same 
effect on corneal ulcers and RCE. Conclusions: Poor diabetic control, diabetic 
neuropathy, and ocular procedures are the risk factors for OSD. 
Antihyperglycemic agents, except metformin, can prevent OSD in patients with 
T2DM. Additionally, DED and TPPV are risk factors for corneal ulcers but not for 
RCE. A prospective randomized controlled trial is required to confirm our 
results.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to understand real-world use of 
Tirzepatide among people without type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnoses in the United 
States in the MerativeTM MarketScan® Commercial (MarketScan) and Optum 
Clinformatics Claims (CDM) databases.
METHODS: This retrospective, observational, descriptive study used data from the 
MarketScan and Optum CDM databases (index date: first-observed Tirzepatide 
claim) from May 2021 to September 2023. Key eligibility criteria included age 
≥18 years, ≥1 Tirzepatide claim, no baseline T2D diagnosis codes or 
antihyperglycemic medication use (except metformin), and continuous medical and 
pharmacy enrollment for ≥12 months pre-index. Demographic characteristics were 
assessed at the index date, while clinical characteristics and treatment-related 
data were identified during the 12-month pre-index period. Tirzepatide 
persistence and utilization (6 months post index) were assessed for individuals 
with ≥6 months of follow-up after initiation of Tirzepatide treatment (index 
date). Data were analyzed separately for each database.
FINDINGS: Overall, 15,534 eligible adults were identified in the MarketScan 
database and 6800 in the Optum CDM database; mean age was 46.2 years and 55.9 
years, respectively, and in both databases, >70% were female. A total of 70.6% 
(MarketScan) and 81.0% (Optum CDM) of individuals had at least one 
obesity-related complication, with the most prevalent being hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and pre-diabetes. There were 8709 individuals in the MarketScan 
database and 3384 in the Optum CDM database with ≥6 months of follow-up. In both 
databases, approximately two-thirds of people were started on 2.5 mg and, by the 
sixth prescription fill, the most common doses of Tirzepatide were 5 mg and 7.5 
mg. Tirzepatide persistence ranged from 60.6% to 75.7% across both databases, 
with an allowed gap between prescriptions of 45 days or 60 days. Of individuals 
who discontinued tirzepatide, 10.2-19.5% restarted Tirzepatide during the 
6-month follow-up.
IMPLICATIONS: In both databases, most people initiating Tirzepatide without T2D 
diagnoses had ≥1 obesity-related complication, indicating that Tirzepatide is 
being used in people with multimorbidity. A high proportion of people who 
initiated Tirzepatide were persistent on treatment at 6 months, which is higher 
than that previously reported for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are 
antihyperglycemic agents used to control type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
Recently, there has been increased recognition of the potential pulmonary 
protective effects of GLP-1RA. Given the bidirectional association between T2DM 
and obstructive lung disease (OLD) incidence and progression, our systematic 
review aimed to determine if GLP-1RA therapy for comorbid T2DM was associated 
with a decreased risk of asthma and COPD exacerbations, relative to other T2DM 
treatments.
METHODS: We systematically searched for English-language articles published in 
Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases from inception to 
June 25, 2024. Random effects meta-analysis was used to aggregate data where 
feasible.
RESULTS: Of 23 full-text manuscripts considered for inclusion, six retrospective 
observational studies were selected (total N = 62,678). The pooled incidence 
rate ratios (IRR) of asthma or COPD exacerbations demonstrated a statistically 
significant lower risk of exacerbations associated with GLP-1RA compared to 
sulfonylureas (IRR, 95 %CI: 0.52, 0.42-0.64) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors (DPP-4I) (IRR 0.63, 0.47-0.86), but not sodium glucose 
cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2I) (IRR 0.66, 0.21-2.05). The risk of 
exacerbations rate was also lower in GLP-1RA users relative to insulin in a 
single study (IRR 0.39, 0.26-0.58) and higher compared to metformin in a single 
Japanese cohort (IRR 1.24, 1.08-1.43).
CONCLUSION: Our systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence for a 
reduced risk for asthma and COPD exacerbations associated with GLP-1RA use in 
adults with OLD and T2DM, relative to sulfonylureas or DPP-4I medications. 
Future research should focus on confirming our observed relationships in 
prospective trials.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP-1RAs) have been demonstrated in treatment of type 2 diabetes and weight 
management, their potential role in cancer prevention remains inadequately 
explored.
METHODS: Using the TriNetX Research Network, we conducted a retrospective cohort 
study comparing new users of GLP-1RAs with users of other glucose-lowering 
medications. Propensity score matching was performed for demographic factors, 
socioeconomic factors, family history, lifestyle factors and cancer risk 
factors. The primary outcome was the incidence of obesity-related 
gastrointestinal cancers, and secondary outcomes were the incidence of 
individual cancer types.
RESULTS: Using adjusted HRs (aHRs), GLP-1RA use was found to be associated with 
a significantly lower risk of overall gastrointestinal cancer compared with all 
other glucose-lowering medications (insulin: aHR 0.29; 95% CI 0.23, 0.37; 
metformin: aHR 0.84; 95% CI 0.71, 0.99; sulfonylureas: aHR 0.71; 95% CI 0.62, 
0.80; thiazolidinediones: aHR 0.86; 95% CI 0.74, 0.99; dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors: aHR 0.80; 95% CI 0.70, 0.91; sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 
inhibitors: aHR 0.80; 95% CI 0.68, 0.96). The protective effect was most 
pronounced compared with insulin therapy, with significant risk reductions 
across all individual cancers.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: GLP-1RA use is associated with a reduced risk of 
gastrointestinal cancers in individuals with type 2 diabetes. These findings 
suggest potential cancer-protective benefits of GLP-1RAs beyond their 
established roles in glycaemic management and weight reduction.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor 
agonist (GLP-1RA) use and risk of incident thyroid tumors.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The retrospective, active-comparator new-user 
cohort study used international administrative claims and electronic health 
record databases. Participants included patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) with prior metformin therapy initiating a GLP-1RA versus new users of 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
inhibitors (DPP-4is), and sulfonylureas (SUs). The outcome was incident thyroid 
tumor and thyroid malignancy. Propensity score matching and stratification were 
used to adjust for confounders with an intention-to-treat and on-treatment 
strategy. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) pooled using a 
random-effects meta-analysis. Unmeasured confounding was evaluated using 
negative outcomes, with calibration of the HR.
RESULTS: A total of 460,032 users of GLP-1RAs, 717,792 users of SGLT2is, 
2,055,583 users of DPP-4is, and 1,119,868 users of SUs were included. Only U.S. 
cohorts passed study diagnostics. Thyroid tumor incidence ranged from 0.88 to 
1.03 per 1,000 person-years in GLP-1RA cohorts. GLP-1RA exposure was not 
associated with an increased risk of thyroid tumors compared with SGLT2is, 
DPP-4is, or SUs (meta-analysis: GLP-1RA vs. SGLT2i HR range from 0.83 [95% CI 
0.57-1.27] to 0.95 [0.85-1.06]; GLP-1RA vs. SU HR range from 0.95 [0.75-1.20] to 
1.03 [0.87-1.23]; GLP-1RA vs. DPP-4i HR range from 0.78 [0.60-1.01] to 0.93 
[0.83-1.04]). Analysis using thyroid malignancy and including a 1-year lag 
period produced similar conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM initiating second-line treatments, we 
observed no increased risk of thyroid tumors with GLP-1RA exposure.

AIMS: In patients with new onset type 2 diabetes, this study aimed to analyze 
glucose-lowering medication use patterns between 2014 and 2022.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included adults with incident 
type 2 diabetes in the University of California Health System between 2014 and 
2022. We determined medications used within 1 year of diagnosis and evaluated 
statistical evidence of use pattern changes via Mann-Kendall trend tests. Four 
categories of high-risk patients requiring cardio-kidney-metabolic protection 
were also evaluated in stratified analyses based on 2024 ADA guidelines.
RESULTS: Of 40 150 patients with incident type 2 diabetes, 38.5% initiated 
glucose-lowering medication within 1 year. Metformin remained the most used 
medication from 2014 to 2022. From 2014 to 2022, usage of GLP-1 receptor 
agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors increased exponentially. GLP-1 receptor agonist 
use increased from below 2.5%-21%. While SGLT-2 inhibitor use increased from 
less than 2.5%-14%. This growth coincided with a decline in sulfonylurea usage. 
Among high-risk, insulin was most prevalent in those with heart failure or 
chronic kidney disease. However, usage of insulin declined overall in all 
groups. Utilization of SGLT-2 inhibitors was particularly high in patients with 
prior heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults with new onset type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 receptor agonist 
and SGLT-2 inhibitor utilization has markedly increased, coordinating with 
evolving guidelines that emphasize cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease 
management. However, overall adoption rates of these medications remain low 
based on indicated populations. Sulfonylurea use declined while metformin 
remains the most frequently initiated treatment.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting over 
90% of diabetes patients worldwide. The condition is driven by genetic 
predispositions, environmental factors, obesity, and physical inactivity. 
Pharmacological treatments range from metformin to newer agents, including GLP-1 
analogues and SGLT-2 inhibitors, which target different aspects of glucose 
metabolism. The review highlights advancements in clinical trials for T2DM 
treatments, focusing on recent and ongoing research. Clinical trial data were 
sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov, and the search criteria focused on trials that 
were published with monotherapy of T2DM having results within the last six 
years, specifically from 2019 to 2024. The clinical trials of the patients under 
the age group of adults (18 to 64 years) and older adults (>64 years) were 
included. The data are mentioned in inverse chronological order with respect to 
study duration. The clinical trial data suggest promising results in managing 
hemoglobin A1c and body weight. However, adverse events such as cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, and bone-related issues and other issues such as diabetic 
ketoacidosis and pancreatitis were reported in some cases. Dulaglutide, 
tripeptide, and oral insulin showed promising therapeutic effects in clinical 
trials. Despite significant progress, the management of T2DM remains 
challenging, emphasizing the need for ongoing innovation in treatment approaches 
to improve patient quality of life and reduce the global burden of the disease.

Impact of Antidepressants on Weight Gain: Underlying Mechanisms and Mitigation 
Strategies.

Antidepressants are widely prescribed for major depressive disorder and anxiety, 
yet their long-term use is associated with weight gain, affecting up to 55-65% 
of patients. This adverse effect contributes to treatment discontinuation, 
relapse, and worsened metabolic health outcomes, including increased risk for 
obesity and type 2 diabetes. This artic le presents a critical evaluation of the 
published reports on the mechanisms underlying antidepressant-induced weight 
gain, comparative effects across drug classes, and mitigation strategies. Weight 
gain varies significantly by antidepressant class. Tricyclic antidepressants, 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and a tetracyclic antidepressant, mirtazapine, are 
associated with the most substantial weight increases, while selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors typically induce weight gain after prolonged use. Mechanisms 
involve serotonergic and dopaminergic signaling, receptor desensitization, 
insulin resistance, and altered leptin and ghrelin levels. Genetic factors, 
including CYP2C19 metabolizer status, and lifestyle factors such as baseline 
body mass index and diet, further influence risk. Bupropion, a 
norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is the only commonly prescribed 
antidepressant consistently associated with weight loss or neutrality. 
Mitigation strategies include switching medications, adding agents like 
metformin or GLP-1 receptor agonists, and incorporating behavioral 
interventions. Antidepressant-induced weight gain is a multifactorial issue 
requiring individualized management. Understanding pharmacologic mechanisms and 
patient-specific risk factors is essential for optimizing treatment efficacy 
while minimizing metabolic burden.

BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 Is), glucagon-like 
peptidase 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 
inhibitors (SGLT-2 Is) may contribute to better control of COPD due to their 
anti-inflammatory effects, like those observed with metformin. We aimed to 
investigate the association of these novel antihyperglycaemic drugs versus 
metformin with fewer COPD exacerbations in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) 
comorbid with COPD.
METHODS: Using the national administrative database covering 99% of the medical 
facilities in Japan, we constructed three active comparators new-user cohorts 
comprising 36 317 patients with T2DM and COPD who initiated treatment with the 
novel antihyperglycaemic drugs and metformin between 2014 and 2022. Patients' 
backgrounds were balanced using overlap propensity score weighting. We 
calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the initial occurrence of COPD exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids 
using a weighted Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: DPP-4 Is were associated with a higher incidence of exacerbations 
requiring systemic corticosteroids (22.4 versus 20.4 per 100 person-years; HR 
1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.25) compared with metformin. In contrast, the incidence of 
such exacerbations in the GLP-1 RAs (30.1 versus 24.4 per 100 person-years; HR 
1.07, 95% CI 0.87-1.32) and SGLT-2 Is (20.7 versus 21.8 per 100 person-years; HR 
1.00, 95% CI 0.94-1.06) groups were comparable with that in the metformin group.
CONCLUSIONS: While DPP-4 Is were associated with poorer control of COPD compared 
with metformin, GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 Is offered COPD control comparable with

Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder that affects multiple 
organs, leading to severe complications in the pancreas, kidneys, liver, and 
heart. Prolonged hyperglycemia, along with oxidative stress and chronic 
inflammation, plays a crucial role in accelerating tissue damage, significantly 
increasing the risk of diabetic complications such as nephropathy, hepatopathy, 
and cardiovascular disease. This review evaluates the protective effects of 
various antidiabetic treatments on organ tissues affected by T2D, based on 
findings from experimental animal models. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic 
agent, has been widely recognized for its ability to reduce inflammation and 
oxidative stress, thereby mitigating diabetes-induced organ damage. Its 
protective role extends beyond glucose regulation, offering benefits such as 
improved mitochondrial function and reduced fibrosis in affected tissues. In 
addition to traditional therapies, new classes of antidiabetic drugs, including 
sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptor agonists not only improve glycemic control but also exhibit 
nephroprotective and cardioprotective properties by reducing glomerular 
hyperfiltration, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Similarly, GLP-1 receptor 
agonists have been associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and enhanced 
cardiovascular function. Preclinical studies suggest that tirzepatide, a dual 
GLP-1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor agonist may offer superior 
metabolic benefits compared to conventional GLP-1 agonists by improving β-cell 
function, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and reducing fatty liver progression. 
Despite promising preclinical results, differences between animal models and 
human physiology pose a challenge. Further clinical research is needed to 
confirm these effects and refine treatment strategies. Future T2D management 
aims to go beyond glycemic control, emphasizing organ protection and long-term 
disease prevention.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that dietary interventions and 
metabolic surgery lead to higher rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission, 
improving beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. There is limited data on 
the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions targeting T2D remission. We 
aimed to search clinical trial registries and perform a systematic mapping of 
registered randomized clinical trials of pharmacological interventions targeting 
T2D remission; summarizing the existing research space, and identifying gaps for 
future research. We searched three clinical trial registries: 
Clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials 
Registry Platform and the European Union Clinical Trials Information System on 
the 19th March 2024. Key outcomes included sample size, interventions, 
comparators, definition of T2D remission, follow-up duration, funding source, 
eligibility criteria, trial completion status, publication status, and 
availability of published results. The search yielded 1108 results, of which 34 
trials were included. The majority were non-industry funded (70.6%, n = 24) and 
88.2% (n = 30) of trials targeted remission of T2D diagnosed within 6 years. 
Approximately 56% (n = 19) of trials used pharmacological combination therapy 
with mainly metformin, insulin, and a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist. 
The majority of studies (35.3%, n = 12) did not register defined specific 
criteria to determine remission and there was a lack of consistency in methods 
of beta-cell function measurement. We suggest that future research use a 
standardized definition of T2D remission and the beta-cell function method. 
Future trials should focus on using GLP-1 receptor agonists and GIP analogs, and 
their role in weight loss and T2D.Registration: PROSPERO CRD42024511198.

Insulin resistance (IR) plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of 
comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and depression (CDD) through 
multifaceted mechanisms, including dysregulation of insulin signaling (both 
central and peripheral), neuroendocrine disturbances 
(hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction and monoaminergic 
neurotransmission impairment), chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, 
disruption of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, reduced brain-derived neurotrophic 
factor levels, and altered synaptic plasticity. These IR-related pathways may 
predispose individuals to depressive symptoms or exacerbate existing mood 
disorders. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is critical for 
developing integrated therapeutic strategies that concurrently target metabolic 
and psychiatric dysfunction. Antidepressant medications exhibit divergent 
effects on glucose metabolism. Tricyclic antidepressants, particularly 
amitriptyline and nortriptyline, worsen metabolic profiles by exacerbating IR, 
promoting weight gain, and inducing hyperglycemia, thereby increasing diabetes 
risk with prolonged use. Consequently, tricyclic antidepressants should be 
avoided in metabolically vulnerable populations unless alternatives are 
unavailable. Mirtazapine presents a paradoxical profile-while its 
appetite-stimulating effects often lead to weight gain (a known IR risk factor), 
some evidence suggests potential β-cell function preservation, necessitating 
cautious use of mirtazapine in individuals with metabolic syndrome. Among 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine and escitalopram demonstrate 
favorable metabolic effects, including improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic 
control, though hypoglycemia risk (particularly with concomitant sulfonylureas) 
warrants monitoring. Bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, 
uniquely promotes weight loss and enhances glycemic control, making it a 
preferred option for depression comorbid with obesity or T2DM. Agomelatine, with 
its neutral metabolic profile and circadian rhythm-modulating properties, 
represents a safer alternative for patients with metabolic concerns. 
Concurrently, certain antidiabetic agents show promise in managing depression. 
Metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may be prioritized for 
diabetic patients at risk for depression, while glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
agonists appear particularly beneficial for obesity-related mood disturbances. 
Thiazolidinediones offer value in treatment-resistant cases, whereas insulin 
secretagogues should be used cautiously in psychiatrically vulnerable 
individuals. Future research should prioritize three key directions: (1) 
Mechanistic investigations using advanced neuroimaging to elucidate the 
contribution of IR to depressive phenotypes and evaluate novel interventions 
(such as intranasal insulin); (2) Precision medicine approaches incorporating 
biomarkers, including genetic polymorphisms, inflammatory markers, and gut 
microbiome signatures, to optimize antidepressant selection and develop 
personalized treatment algorithms; and (3) Therapeutic innovation, including 
dual GLP-1/GIP agonists and anti-inflammatory-antidepressant combinations, as 
well as integrating digital health technologies (e.g., continuous glucose 
monitoring coupled with mood tracking), will enable real-time, data-driven 
management. These advances will be instrumental in establishing integrated care 
paradigms for this comorbidity, which intertwines metabolic and psychiatric 
conditions.
